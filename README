String-Template
===============

Exports a single function expand_string($template, \%fields).

Fills in a simple template with values from a hash, replacing tokens
like "<fieldname>" with the value from the hash $fields->{fieldname}.

Some special characters can be used to impose formatting on the
fields:

 % - treat like a sprintf() format
 : - treat like a POSIX::strftime() format
 ! - Just like ':', but with gmtime() instead of localtime()
 # - treat like a substr()

For the ':' strftime formats, the field is parsed by Date::Parse,
so it can handle any format that can handle.
